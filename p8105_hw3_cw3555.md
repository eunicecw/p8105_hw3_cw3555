### Problem 1

#### Read in the data

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart |> 
  as_tibble()
```

#### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
representing a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_cw3555_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="90%" />

Our next table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

### Problem 2

#### Read in the data

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

#### Data cleaning

``` r
brfss_smart2010_df = 
  brfss_smart2010 |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(
    topic=="Overall Health",
    response %in% c("Excellent","Very good","Good","Fair","Poor")
 ) |> 
mutate(
  response = factor(response, levels= c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"), ordered= TRUE)
 ) |> 
rename(state=locationabbr,location=locationdesc)
```

#### Using data to answer the following questions

- Q: In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations?

``` r
brfss_smart2010_df |> 
  filter(year==2002) |> 
  group_by(year, state) |> 
  summarize(distinct_locations = n_distinct(location)) |> 
  filter(distinct_locations>=7)|> 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| year | state | distinct_locations |
|-----:|:------|-------------------:|
| 2002 | CT    |                  7 |
| 2002 | FL    |                  7 |
| 2002 | MA    |                  8 |
| 2002 | NC    |                  7 |
| 2002 | NJ    |                  8 |
| 2002 | PA    |                 10 |

- A: In 2002, total 6 states are observed at 7 or more locations: CT,
  FL, MA, NC, NJ, PA.

- Q: What about in 2010?

``` r
brfss_smart2010_df |> 
  filter(year==2010) |> 
  group_by(year, state) |> 
  summarize(distinct_locations = n_distinct(location)) |> 
  filter(distinct_locations>=7) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| year | state | distinct_locations |
|-----:|:------|-------------------:|
| 2010 | CA    |                 12 |
| 2010 | CO    |                  7 |
| 2010 | FL    |                 41 |
| 2010 | MA    |                  9 |
| 2010 | MD    |                 12 |
| 2010 | NC    |                 12 |
| 2010 | NE    |                 10 |
| 2010 | NJ    |                 19 |
| 2010 | NY    |                  9 |
| 2010 | OH    |                  8 |
| 2010 | PA    |                  7 |
| 2010 | SC    |                  7 |
| 2010 | TX    |                 16 |
| 2010 | WA    |                 10 |

- A: In 2002, total 14 states are observed at 7 or more locations: CA,
  CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA.

- Q: Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
  contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
  across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
  average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a
  line for each state across years – the geom_line geometry and group
  aesthetic will help).

``` r
brfss_excellent_repsonse_df=
  brfss_smart2010_df |> 
  filter(response=="Excellent") |> 
  group_by(year, state) |> 
  summarize(mean_value = mean(data_value, na.rm =TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
brfss_excellent_repsonse_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=mean_value, color=state))+
  geom_line(alpha=0.7)+
labs(
    title = "Average Value of 'Excellent' Health Response Over Time Within a State",
    x= "Year(2002-2010)",
    y= "Average Value of Overall Health Reponse",
    caption = "Data of 'Excellent Reponses' from BRFSS data"
  )+
   theme_classic()
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_cw3555_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />

A: This above “spaghetti” plot shows the average value of “excellent”
health response over time within a state. Each line with different
colors represent different states. Most states have a volatile pattern
from 2002-2010, containing both increasing and decreasing trends. Though
they all perceive their overall health as excellent, there are times
that they consider it to be improved and worsened.

- Q: Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
  distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
  locations in NY State

``` r
brfss_2006_2010_NY_df =
  brfss_smart2010_df |> 
  filter(year%in% c("2006", "2010"), state == "NY") 

brfss_2006_2010_NY_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=response, y= data_value))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(.~ year)+
  labs(
    title = "Distirbution of Value of Health Response for 2006 and 2010 in NY",
    x= "Response(Poor-Excellent)",
    y= "Value of Overall Health Reponse",
    caption = "Data of 'Year 2006 & 2010 in NY' from BRFSS data"
  ) 
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_cw3555_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />

- A: This two-panel box plot shows the distribution of value of health
  response ((“Poor” to “Excellent”) for 2006 and 2010 in NY. Comparing
  the two panel, it can be inferred that there are some improvements in
  one’s perception of their over health comparing 2006 and 2010. The
  median value of “Very good” response increased and the 25th and 75th
  interquartile also increased. There are also slight increases in
  median value of “Fair”and “Good” response.

### Problem 3

#### Load and tidy the data

``` r
nhanes_covar_df =
  read.csv("problem_3_data/nhanes_covar.csv", skip=4) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    sex= case_match(
      sex,
      1~ "Male",
      2~ "Female"
    ),
    education = case_match(
      education,
      1 ~ "Less than high school",
      2 ~ "High school equivalent",
      3 ~ "More than high school"
    ), 
    sex= as.factor(sex),
    education=as.factor(education)
  ) |> 
  filter(age>=21) |> 
  drop_na()
  
nhanes_accel_df =
  read.csv("problem_3_data/nhanes_accel.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("min"),
    names_to = "minute",
    values_to = "activity",
    names_prefix = "min"
  ) |> 
  mutate(minute=as.numeric(minute))
```

#### Merge the data

``` r
nhances_df= 
  left_join(nhanes_covar_df,nhanes_accel_df, by="seqn")
```

#### Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each education category

``` r
  nhances_df |> 
  group_by(sex,education) |> 
  summarize(n_obs=n())|> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = sex,
    values_from = n_obs
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'. You can override using the `.groups`
    ## argument.

| education              | Female |  Male |
|:-----------------------|-------:|------:|
| High school equivalent |  33120 | 50400 |
| Less than high school  |  40320 | 38880 |
| More than high school  |  84960 | 80640 |

The table shows that there are more men who are in the high school
equivalent category than women , and more women who are in the more than
high school(highest education group among the three) and less than high
school(lowest education group among the three) ) categories than men.

#### Create a visualization of the age distributions for men and women in each education category.

``` r
nhances_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=education,y=age, fill=sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Age Distributions for Men and Women in Each Education Category ",
       x= "Education Category",
       y= "Age",
       caption = "Data from merged dataset 'nhances_df'"
       )+
       theme_classic()
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_cw3555_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="90%" />

The plot shows the age distributions for men and women in three
different education categories. Age of those in more than high school
category is younger than those in less than high school category and
high school equivalent category. Age of female in high school equivalent
category is less than age of female in less than high school category,
while the distrbution of age of men in both categories are similar.

#### Aggregate across minutes to create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot these total activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis).

``` r
aggregated_df= 
  nhances_df |> 
  group_by(seqn,sex,age,education) |> 
  summarize(total_activities=sum(activity))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'seqn', 'sex', 'age'. You can override
    ## using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
aggregated_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=age, y=total_activities,color=sex))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.7)+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(.~education)+
  labs(title = "Distirbutrion of Total Activities Against Age for Men and Women in Each Education Category",
       x= "Age",
       y= "Total Activities",
       caption = "Data from aggregated dataset 'aggregated_df'"
       )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'

<img src="p8105_hw3_cw3555_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="90%" />

The panel plot shows the relationship between total activities and age
for men and women in different education categories by separating three
sub panels. From the smooth line, we can see that there is a negative
relationship between total activities and age. As age increases, total
activities decrease. In each sub panels, we can see that women generally
have more activities than men in all ages excepted when in less than
high school category, men who are have more than 40 have more activities
than women more than 40. People in more than high school category tends
to have a more gentle decreasing trend of activities as age increases
compared with the other two categories.

#### Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each education level and use color to indicate sex.

``` r
nhances_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=minute, y=activity, color=sex))+
  geom_line(alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
  facet_grid(.~education)+
  labs(title = "24-hour Activity Time Courses for Men and Women in Each Education Category",
       x= "Time in Mins of a Day",
       y= "Activity",
       caption = "Data from merged dataset 'nhances_df'"
       )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_cw3555_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="90%" />

The three-panel plot shows the 24-hour activity time courses (how
activities change over time in a day) for men and women in three
education levels. From the smooth line in each panel, we can see people
tend to have most activities during 500-1000 mins in a day and least
activities during 0-250 mins of a day. From the three panels, we can see
that the two smooth lines for each gender are close to each other in
high school equivalent and less than high school categories, which
indicates that men and women have similar trends of activities in a day.
However, for the more than high school category, women tends to have
more activities in the middle of a day than men.
